# design-patterns-examples

Main goal of this project is to get some hands-on experience with design patterns. Idea for the project is taken from the class "Design Patterns" at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb. Considering that the main goal of the project is to practically use some of the more common design patterns, all functionalities are implemented with only core Java GUI classes (i. e. drawing string on canvas, instead of using JTextArea for text editor).
